              <h1>Diabetic Retinopathy</h1>
              <div class="mt-4"></div>
              <h3>What is diabetic retinopathy?</h3>
              <p>
                Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision
                loss and blindness in people who have diabetes. It affects blood
                vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in
                the back of your eye).<br />
                If you have diabetes, it’s important to get a comprehensive
                dilated eye exam at least once a year.
                <br />
                Diabetic retinopathy may not have any symptoms at first — but
                finding it early can help you take steps to protect your vision.

              <h3>What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy?</h3>
              <div style="display: flex">
                <p>
                  The early stages of diabetic retinopathy usually don’t have
                  any symptoms. Some people notice changes in their vision, like
                  trouble reading or seeing faraway objects. These changes may
                  come and go.
                  <br />
                  In later stages of the disease, blood vessels in the retina
                  start to bleed into the vitreous (gel-like fluid that fills
                  your eye). If this happens, you may see dark, floating spots
                  or streaks that look like cobwebs. Sometimes, the spots clear
                  up on their own — but it’s important to get treatment right
                  away. Without treatment, scars can form in the back of the
                  eye. Blood vessels may also start to bleed again, or the
                  bleeding may get worse.

              <h3>Am I at risk for diabetic retinopathy?</h3>
              <p>
                Anyone with any kind of diabetes can get diabetic retinopathy —
                including people with type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes
                (a type of diabetes that can develop during pregnancy).
                <br />
                Your risk increases the longer you have diabetes. Over time,
                more than half of people with diabetes will develop diabetic
                retinopathy. The good news is that you can lower your risk of
                developing diabetic retinopathy by controlling your diabetes.
                <br />
                Women with diabetes who become pregnant — or women who develop
                gestational diabetes — are at high risk for getting diabetic
                retinopathy. If you have diabetes and are pregnant, have a
                comprehensive dilated eye exam as soon as possible. Ask your
                doctor if you’ll need additional eye exams during your
                pregnancy.
              </p>

              <h3>What’s the treatment for diabetic retinopathy?</h3>
              <p>
                In the early stages of diabetic retinopathy, your eye doctor
                will probably just keep track of how your eyes are doing. Some
                people with diabetic retinopathy may need a comprehensive
                dilated eye exam as often as every 2 to 4 months.
                <br />
                In later stages, it’s important to start treatment right away —
                especially if you have changes in your vision. While it won’t
                undo any damage to your vision, treatment can stop your vision
                from getting worse. It’s also important to take steps to control
                your diabetes, blood pressure, and cholesterol.
